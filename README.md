# flask-auth
A simple Flask session based authentication example.

I created this after not finding a simple way to do Flask authentication without SQLAlchemy.  Why?  Sometimes it's nice to have a little more control over what you do.  The example isn't perfect but it should work as of 2020 with the latest Flask and Python 3.8.X.
